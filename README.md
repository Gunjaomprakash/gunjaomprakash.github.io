# Om Prakash Gunja - Portfolio

This repository contains the deployed version of my personal portfolio website.

## About

This is a static site built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The source code for this site is maintained in a separate private repository.

## Development

If you'd like to suggest changes or report issues with the site, please email me directly instead of creating issues or pull requests here, as this repository is only used for hosting the built site.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [your-github-pages-url].
